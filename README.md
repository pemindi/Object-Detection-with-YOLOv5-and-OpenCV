# 🎯 Object Detection with YOLOv5 and OpenCV

During my break, I decided to invest my time productively by diving into a **real-time object detection** project using **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV**.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying various **objects in a bedroom environment** using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model. The goal was to accurately identify and label different types of furniture and decor items commonly found in indoor living spaces.

### 🧠 What I Did

- 🖼️ Collected and annotated images representing common bedroom objects  
- 🧪 Trained a YOLOv5 model with custom-labeled data  
- 🧰 Integrated the model with OpenCV for real-time video stream detection  
- 🎯 Tested and evaluated the model's accuracy in live settings

### 🛏️ Objects Classified

Below are the object classes I trained the model to detect, along with their respective image counts:

| Object Class         | Image Count |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Lighting Fixtures    | 269         |
| Table Furniture      | 240         |
| Bed                  | 236         |
| Storage Furniture    | 192         |
| Seating Furniture    | 179         |
| Indoor Plant         | 172         |
| Rug                  | 152         |
| Wall Decorations     | 145         |
| Window               | 134         |
| Mirror               | 77          |
| Screen               | 57          |
| Air Conditioner      | 32          |

### 🚀 Technologies Used

- YOLOv5 (PyTorch)
- OpenCV (Real-time video processing)
- LabelImg (for dataset annotation)
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
